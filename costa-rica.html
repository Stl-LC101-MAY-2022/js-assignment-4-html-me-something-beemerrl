        <p>A few years after my affair with Maggie the Moped, I found myself interested in more entrepreneurial pursuits. I started asking myself, "How could I blend my love of travel, cultural immersion, and education?" The answer? Build a youth program to make international travel possible for low-income youth in St. Louis. The key? <a href="https://www.workaway.info/">Workaway</a>, a platform that allows young, broke travelers to find host sites across the globe. In exchange for a few hours of work each day, you could live for free at a coffee farm in Guatemala or a hostel in Spain. I attempted to use this model to start my own organization, BeyondSTL, which would take local St. Louis high school students on an international immersive cultural experience. </p>
        <p>The 19-year-old me went so far as visiting and vetting host sites in Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Belize! The first stop was the Dreamsea Surf Camp, a communal camp tucked in the jungles on the Nicoya Peninsula of Costa Rica. From there, I was able to visit schools in Guatemala and cacao farms in Belize. Unfortunately, BeyondSTL never fully materialized, but at least my close friend, Robbie, and I got to learn how to shred some waves in the process.</p>
