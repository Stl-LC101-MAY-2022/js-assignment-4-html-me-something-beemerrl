        <p>While this photo was taken back in July 2021, this adventure has only just begun. In this photo you'll see Richard and Sydney cheesin' like they've never cheesed before. Making it to the top of Mt. Evans in Rocky Mountain National Park was one of the best moments of this road trip with the best person I've ever met. <br><br>We started seeing each other on strictly "casual" terms in the spring of 2021. Less than a year later, we're engaged and looking forward to spending the rest of our lives together.</p>
