    <p>It was the summer of 2016. I had just finished my freshman year at Saint Louis Universtiy and my best friend, Cameron, had just graduated high school. We had a 6-week long European backpacking trip planned to be <em>epic</em>. Our journey was scheduled to take us all the way to Ireland, England, Belgium, Germany, and the Czech Republic. Before we left, Cam asked, "Can I bring my girlfriend?"<br><br><em>"What could go wrong?"</em> I thought. "For sure! The more the merrier," I responded <br><br>Well, it turns out, a lot actually... Long story short, Cam and his new girlfriend found themselves shouting, screaming, and fighting for the <em>entire</em> trip. Our great adventure spoiled by a romance gone sour... At a bar in downtown London, as their very boisterous, very public battles continued, I left. Just got up and walked out. I went back to the hostel. I found a moped for sale online for 450 pounds in St. Margaret's Bay, near Dover. Having never ridden a moped before, I remember thinking, "It can't be that hard!" When Cam and his girlfriend returned to the hostel, I told them I bought a bus to St. Margaret's Bay, near Dover and will be leaving in the morning. I'll take the ferry into France and ride my moped into Belgium. Maybe I'll see them there. This was just the beginning of one of the best adventures of my life. In the picture above, you can see Maggie - my Honda Vision 49cc moped parked by the white cliffs of Dover right before we hopped on the ferry.</p>
