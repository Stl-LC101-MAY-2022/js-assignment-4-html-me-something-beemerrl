               <p>It was the summer of 2016. I had just finished my freshman year at Saint Louis Universtiy and my best friend, Cameron, had just graduated high school. We had a 6-week long European backpacking trip planned to be <em>epic</em>. Our journey was scheduled to take us all the way to Ireland, England, Belgium, Germany, and the Czech Republic. Before we left, Cam asked, "Can I bring my girlfriend?"<br><br>"What could go wrong?" I thought.<br><br>Well, it turns out, a lot actually... Long story short, Cam and his new girlfriend found themselves shouting, screaming, and fighting for the <em>entire</em> trip. Our great adventure spoiled by a romance gone sour... At a bar in downtown London, as their very boisterous, very public battles continue, I left. Just got up and walked out. I went back to the hostel. I found a moped for sale online for 450 pounds in St. Margaret's Bay, near Dover. Having never ridden a moped before, I remember thinking, "It can't be that hard!" When Cam and his girlfriend returned, I told them I bought a bus to St. Margaret's Bay, near Dover, and will be leaving in the morning. I'll take the ferry into France and ride my moped into Belgium. Maybe I'll see them there.</p>
               <p>This was just the beginning of one of the best adventures of my life. In the picture above, you can see Maggie - my Honda Vision 49cc moped parked by the white cliffs of Dover right before we hopped on the ferry.</p>

               <p>A few years after my affair with Maggie the Moped, I found myself interested in more entrepreneurial pursuits. At a young age, I realized traveling to cultures vastly different from my own could be incredibly formative and eye-opening. I learned about an organization called Workaway, which allowed young, broke travelers to find host sites across the globe. In exchange for a few hours of work each day, you could live for free at a coffee farm in Guatemala or a hostel in Spain. I attempted to use this model to start my own organization, BeyondSTL, which would take local St. Louis city high school students on an international immersive cultural experience. </p>
               <p>The 19-year-old me went so far as visiting and vetting host sites in Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Belize! The first stop was the Dreamsea Surf Camp, a communal camp tucked in the jungles on the Nicoya Peninsula of Costa Rica. Unfortunately, BeyondSTL never fully materialized, but at least my close friend Robbie and I got to learn how to shred some waves in the process.</p>

               <p>This adventure has just begun. We started seeing each other on strictly "casual" terms in the spring of 2021. Less than a year later, we're engaged and looking forward to spending the rest of our lives together.</p>
